# Welcome to the BitChest Project !

## Start this project.
To start this project, you'll need to open two (or more) commands prompts (at your convenience.) As you will need to open the back-end server for the project, and the front application.

This project is developped in React + Laravel 10, to run this project, you will need an admin panel like MAMPP or XAMPP to help you start this project without difficulties and manage properly the database. You should start by the application back-end to avoid errors with the generation of data.

As it, start by opening two commands prompts, and in each one, write:

```cd bitchest_back```

```cd bitchest_front```

And let's proceed to the proper Readme.md inside thoses two new folders.
