<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Vue.js

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
[Vue3] (https://vuejs.org/)

* Neutral, because we already used it in the past.
* Neutral, because we can develop with both different methods and it provide good flexibility.
* Bad, because we didn't use it for a long time and we might have to learn again how to use it.

### React.js

[React] (https://react.dev/)

* Good, because we already used it in the past for a long time.
* Good, because component based framework are easy to use and provide good flexibility.
* Neutral, because we already used it and won't learn anything really new by using it again.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "React.js", because
It's already known by the team and it's easy to use. The team is already familiar with this framework and know some of the librairies that can be used with it.
