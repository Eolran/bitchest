for our commit messages:

-   fix: bug fixes, e.g. fix crash due to deprecated method.
-   feat: new features, e.g. add new method to the module.
-   refactor: code refactor, e.g. migrate from class components to hooks.
-   docs: changes into documentation, e.g. add usage example for the module.
-   test: adding or updating tests, e.g. add integration tests using detox.
-   chore: tooling changes, e.g. change CI config.
